# Zombiepedia

Zombiepedia was a website created out of love for the Call of Duty zombies gamemode during the pandemic. Over the course of Call of Duty Zombies, there have been dozens of maps and gamemodes released by several different studios. While several media outlets and individuals have created guides for these maps, it felt like there was not one place where you could consistently find great information. 

During the midst of the pandemic, a group of friends and I worked on creating Zombiepedia, a website dedicated to providing the best possible information for all zombies maps. All guides were intended to be created as plainly and accessible as possible (no fancy videos or slideshows).

At this time, Zombiepedia is now defunct and will survive solely as an archived repo.
