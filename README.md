# ZombiesTipsTricks

Zombies Tips & Tricks (placeholder name) is a website created out of love for the Call of Duty zombies gamemode. Over the course of its life, many maps from different creators have been released and those maps have been covered by different publications and websites, but I've found that many websites don't cover *every* map. That's where I come in.

I, along with a group of friends, are working on this project to create one dedicated location for all zombies maps. All guides will be easy to read and be written in plain text (meaning no videos or super fancy shmancy slideshows). By doing this, we are hoping to make your Easter Egg completion as easy as possible.
