                <h2>Alpha Omega - Easter Egg</h2>
                <p>Alpha Omega's Easter Egg sets out to tie together the two different "core" zombies crews, Ultimis and Primis. This easter egg is fairly simple compared to some of the others in Black Ops IIII. Despite its' simplicity, we still highly suggest that you use Elixirs and play with a group for your highest chance of success. On most steps of this guide, you will find tips or tricks for things you can do to make completing this easter egg easier.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Opening Pack-A-Punch</h3>
                <p>In order to upgrade your weapons, there are a few things that you must do before the Pack-A-Punch machine becomes available.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turn on power (found in <i>Power House</i>)</li>
                        <li>Begin the ventilation process (found in <i>Generators</i>)</li>
                        <li>Complete the ventilation process at the four houses with green smoke (found on the <i>Surface</i>)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>After you perform these steps, the Pack-A-Punch machine will be available.</p>

                    <h4>Easter Egg Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can complete all of these steps on Round 1 in a multiplayer game if you use a Shopping Free elixir and have a friend turn on power.</li>
                        <li>Try to save killing the normal zombies until the end of the round, this will make maximizing your points easier. It's okay to kill the Nova 6 enhanced zombies as they don't count toward the round cap while in the generator room.</li>
                        <li>In a multiplayer game, to maximize points, have one person bring the Dividend Yield elixir. By using this elixir, one person can kill all of the zombies and share the points with other players, so long as they're nearby.</li>
                    </ul><hr>

                <h3>Step 2: Activating Rushmore</h3>
                <p>After turning on Pack-A-Punch, you can begin performing all of Rushmore's tasks. To find Rushmore, enter the <i>Operations</i> room (the first house on the right when you jump off the spawn ramp) and click on the computer in the back of the room. Rushmore will wake up and begin to give you instructions for necesssary steps to perform.</p>
                <div class = "helpImage">
                    <div class = "photoContainer">
                        <img src = "./rushmore.jpg" alt = "Rushmore Location" onerror = "this.src='https://zombiepedia.net/failed_load.png'" onclick = "imageResize(this)">
                        <div class = "imgCaption">Rushmore Location</div>

                </div><hr>

                <a name = "step_three"></a>
                <h3>Step 3: Finding Staff Codes</h3>
                <p>There are a total of four staff codes that you must find to feed into Rushmore. Each of these codes correspond to a different name, so make sure you enter the correct code when Rushmore asks for it. The first code will always be located in the same spot in the <i>Operations</i> house and will always be the same code (7626). It will be on a table to the left of you when you walk into <i>Operations</i> from the front door. Don't put this code in until you've collected the other three codes as you will have a time limit of one minute to successfully put them in.</p>
                <div class = "helpImage">
                    <div class = "photoContainer">
                        <img src = "./toy_soldier.jpg" alt = "Toy Soldier Code Location" onerror = "this.src='https://zombiepedia.net/failed_load.png'" onclick = "imageResize(this)">

                    </div>
                </div><hr>

                <a name = "step_four"></a>
                <h3>Step 4: Find Clock Codes</h3>
                <p>In order to complete Step 4, you need to have galvaknuckles (purchaseable from the moving truck). Once you have these, find a staticy TV in <i>Beds</i>, <i>Diner</i>, or <i>Lounge</i>. Once here, you must kill a zombie with the galvaknuckles in front of the screen to activate it. At this point, be ready to write down the codes or take a picture of them as they are given quite quickly. These codes will be five characters long and indicate a location and a time. The location indicates a specific house. Within that house, you must find a clock and set that clock to the time given (e.g. A1030 would be house A with the clock set to 10:30). These codes <i>must</i> be put into the clocks in the order that they were given or you will fail this step and have to wait a round to try again. After inputting all of the codes, go back to Rushmore and interact with him. Despite what Rushmore says at this point, you have successfully completed this step and can move onto Step 5. Please note that at this point, you must interact with Rushmore after completing every step to start the next one.</p>
                    <h4>Easter Egg Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After completing this step, a security case will open on the second floor of <i>Operations</i>, revealing a free packed Raygun MKII.</li>
                        <li>This step isn't time limited, so feel free to take as long as you want.</li>
                        <li>Subtitles will help make this step easier as the codes will be read aloud and all players will see the codes printed out on their screen.</li>
                    </ul><hr>

                <a name = "step_five"></a>
                <h3>Step 5: Escort the Red Nova Crawler</h3>
                <p>Once starting this step, a red Nova 6 crawler will spawn somewhere in the basement. Upon finding this crawler, you will need to escort it to the Transfusion Facility. Upon entering this building, walk up to the barrier with stairs behind it and the crawler should crawl through the door and walk up the stairs. If you kill the crawler on this step, you will have to wait until next round for a new one to spawn.
                    <h4>Easter Egg Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to avoid killing any zombies during this time. Though you might not be aiming at the Nova 6 crawler, it is still possible to kill it.</li>
                    </ul><hr>

                <h3>Step 6: Find the Intruder</h3>
                <p>After interacting with Rushmore, head on down to <i>Storage</i> and activate A.D.A.M and lead him to the stairwell between <i>Diner</i> and the backyard of <i>Green House</i>. Once you reach this location, you will hear a voice from inside the door on the stairwell begin to speak and he will throw a 115 canister outside the door. Pick this up and take it to the <i>Transfusion Facility</i> and put it on the shelf. After this, return to Rushmore and talk to him again.</p>

                    <h4>Easter Egg Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's a good idea to wait until the A.D.A.M unit dies before you take the 115 canister back to <i>Transfusion Facility</i> because this robot will kill any zombies it comes across, possibly ending the round.</li>
                    </ul><hr>

                <a name = "step_seven"></a>
                <h3>Step 7: Deliver Rushmore His Server</h3>
                <p>After interacting with Rushmore, you will be told that there is a secret server hidden somewhere in Camp Edward that he needs you to find and bring to him. This location is to the right of the teleporter in <i>Power House</i>. Before beginning this step, make sure you have built the teleporter and have placed one pad in <i>Power House</i> and one in the backyard of <i>Prisoner Holding</i>. At this point, you need to have a Jolting Jack (the blue Nova 6 crawlers) shoot a bolt of electricity at the server and activate it. This part is a bit tricky, so it might take some time. Once this is done, you need to pull out your Path of Sorrows and enter the teleporter pad. Once you reach the backyard of <i>Prisoner Holding</i>, you need to go into the building and run through the side entrance into <i>Operations</i> and place the server into the server rack.</p>

                </div>

                <h4>Easter Egg Tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least one player should bring Stamin-Up and the Path of Sorrows with them in order to complete this. While it is likely possible to do it without these items, it is <i>extremely</i> difficult.</li>
                </ul><hr>

                <a name = "step_eight"></a>
                <h3>Step 8: Finding the Painting Codes</h3>
                <p>In order to complete this step, you will need the Brain Rot PaP perk. There are a total of three paintings around the map which will have a green, glowing aura around them. These paintings can be found in these locations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Down in <i>Beds</i></li>
                    <li>Down in <i>Lounge</i></li>
                    <li>On the staircase leading to the second floor of <i>Green House</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You need to get a Brain Rot zombie to knock the paintings of the wall, which will reveal a code. Each of these three codes needs to be put into Rushmore.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is suggested that you obtain all three codes before you begin to put the codes into Rushmore as you will have one minute to put each code in.</li>

                <h3>Step 9: Restore Power to Camp Edward</h3>
                <p>This step requires you to interact with six different power switches distributed throughout the map. The locations and the orientation of the switches are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beds - UP</li>
                    <li>Diner - UP</li>
                    <li>Solitary - DOWN</li>
                    <li>Generators - UP</li>
                    <li>Storage - DOWN</li>
                    <li>Lounge - DOWN</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This step does not seem to be time limited, so take as much time as you want.</p>
                <hr>

                <a name = "step_ten"></a>
                <h3>Step 10: Build a New Body</h3>
                <p>At the start of this step, three new mannequins will spawn in the map. The locations of which they can spawn are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the backyard of any house</li>
                        <li>In <i>Diner</i></li>
                        <li>In <i>Lounge</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will need to find a specific mannequin that is sparking. Once you find it, make sure all players are in this area and interact with it. This will start a lockdown that you will need to survive to gain access to a part for rebuilding the mannequin located in <i>APD Interrogation</i>. Make sure you grab the body part after the lockdown is complete. Repeat this step another two times to gain access to two more body parts before finally returning to <i>APD Interrogation</i> and putting the parts on the mannequin.</p>

                <h3>Step 11: Escort the Orb</h3>
                <p>Once you interact with Rushmore, it is time to find a blue glowing ball hidden somewhere out of bounds in the map. There are a total of three locations that it can spawn:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a window in <i>Beds</i></li>
                    <li>In a window in the <i>Kitchen</i> of <i>Green House</i></li>
                    <li>In a window in the <i>Office</i> of <i>Yellow House</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you find this orb, it will begin to move and you <i>must</i> follow it. If at any time you lose the orb, it will despawn and you will have to find it again at the start of the next round. The orb's final destination will be in the <i>APD Interrogation</i> room. After a short discussion between the mannequin and Rushmore, you are set to start the next step.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3>Step 12: Boss Fight</h3>
                <p>To start the boss fight, all players must be down in <i>APD Control</i> and must interact with the computer. After doing this, the final part of this Easter Egg will begin. The first part of this is another lockdown. You must kill waves of mannequins around the pyramid, filling up soul canisters and unlocking the pyramid. After completing this part, you will meet an old (or new!) friend who will soon begin to attack you. You will need to fill up soul canisters in different parts of the basement, with each becoming closed to your access after you fill up that canister. The locations of these canisters (plus the recommended route) are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Storage</li>
                        <li>Diner</li>
                        <li>Lounge</li>
                        <li>Beds</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>To start the process of filling these soul canisters, all players must be in the room before it can be interacted with. Once you begin to fill these canisters, pay attention to the audio logs and subtitles because you will need to escape the room as soon as the step is done. If you remain in these rooms, you will perish. Repeat these steps for each room. After completing every room, you need to return to <i>APD Control</i> and push Avogadro back into the pyramid. At this point, you are basically done with the Easter Egg. Your last step is to grab the Elemental Shard from the pyramid.</p>
