                <h3>Ray Gun MKII V (Yellow)</h3>
                <p><i>Please Note: This requires a Pack-a-Punched weapon with Kill-O-Watt</i></p>
                <p>Step 1: Find and shoot the sparking panel on one of the machines in <i>Generators</i> with your Kill-O-Watt gun. After doing this, you can interact with the canister inside and pick it up.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Step Two: Go topside of the map and look for power lines. One of these power lines should be flickering yellow. Shoot this with your Kill-O-Watt weapon. After doing this, a different power line will begin to flicker. Repeat this process until all the power lines connect together.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Step Three: Find <i>Yellow House</i> and go to the generator outside its front door. Once found, interact with it and a circle will appear. To complete this step, you must kill zombies inside this circle until it disappears. Once the circle disappears, you can grab the canister from the generator.</p>
                <p>Step 4: Build the Ray Gun MKII V at the Ray Gun MKII kit location.</p>

                <h3>Ray Gun MKII X (Blue)</h3>
                <p><i>Please Note: This requires a Pack-a-Punched weapon with Cryofreeze</i></p>
                <p>Step 1: Find the container that is shrouded in a glowing blue mist. This can be located in three different locations. Once found, shoot it with your Cryofreeze weapon and pick up the container.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>APD Interrogation</li>

                </div>
                <p>Step 2: Go down to the bunker and find zombies that are glowing with the same blue mist that the previous container was. Once you have found them, you must shoot them with your Cryofreeze weapon until they are frozen. After this, knife them and they will drop a blue goo that you can then pick up. You must do this three times. If you are successful, Rushmore will begin telling you about that the Ray Gun MKII X.</p>
                <p>Step 3: After collecting three samples of the blue goo, you can head on down to <i>APD Control</i>. Once here, go into the computer room and find the container that has a blue liquid in it. Once found, interact with it and you can start collecting souls for it. Kill zombies in the circle until it disappears and then grab the container.</p>
                <p>Step 4: Build the Ray Gun MKII X at the Ray Gun MKII kit location.</p>

                <p>Step 2: Go to the surface and find the house with the chimney with purple smoke. Once you find it, try to land a Wraith Fire on top. If done successfully, Rushmore will begin talking.</p>

                <p>Step 3: Go inside the building that you just landed the Wraith Fire on and interact with the purple fire in the chimney. Upon doing this, you will be able to start collecting zombie souls to charge your Ray Gun canister.</p>
