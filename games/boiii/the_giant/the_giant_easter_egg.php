                <h2>The Giant - Flytrap Easter Egg</h2>

                <hr>

                <h3>Step 1: Get a Pack-a-Punch'd Weapon</h3>
                <p>To begin this easter egg, you need to have a PaP'd weapon. You can get this by turning on Pack-a-Punch and spending 5000 points or you can use Gobblegums, such as Ephemeral Enhancement or Wall Power.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>Step 2: Shoot the Power Switch</h3>
                <p>Go through the door on the left side of spawn and turn to the barrier that looks outside the map. You will see a small control panel that looks like it's attached to a pillar. Shoot this with your PaP'd weapon to start the easter egg.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Shoot the Three Monkeys</h3>
                <p>At this point, three monkeys will spawn around the map that you will be required to shoot. They can be shot in any order and there is one for every teleporter. The monkeys can be found at the following locations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teleporter A: In the right furnace below the box location</li>
                    <li>Teleporter B: In the left pool of water next to the box location</li>
                    <li>Teleporter C: On a railing above power</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 4: Grab Your Free Annihilator</h3>
                <p>In the boiler room underneath Teleporter C, there is an open furnace that will contain a free Annihilator. </p>
