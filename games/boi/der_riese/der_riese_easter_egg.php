                <h2>Der Riese - Fly Trap Easter Egg</h2>
                <p>Please Note: This only works in the World at War and Black Ops version of Der Riese. If you are attempting <a href = "https://zombiepedia.net/games/boiii/the_giant/the_giant.php">The Giant</a>, please refer to our Black Ops III guide.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Activate Pack-a-Punch</h3>

                <p>In order to even begin this "easter egg", as some might call it, the Pack-a-Punch machine is required. To activate, one needs to link each of the three individual teleporters with the one located in the spawn room. These machines are located across the map, at these locations.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teleporter A - Leave spawn through the door to the right of the Pack-a-Punch Machine, then enter the 1250 point door.</li>
                        <li>Teleporter B - Enter the 750 point door to the right of the balcony near Double Tap Root Beer.</li>
                        <li>Teleporter C - Open the 1250 point door behind the power switch, and the Teleporter can be found.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Step 2: Shoot the Objects</h3>

                <p>To activate the Easter Egg, one needs to shoot a panel outside the map between the Spawn Room and the Teleporter A area with a Pack-a-Punched weapon. This spawns three items around the map, all of which need to be shot with a Pack-a-Punched weapon.</p>
